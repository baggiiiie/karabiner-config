This is my config for karabiner, with specifics for my corne and Mac built-in keyboard.

For some unknown reason, on work laptop the following settings are needed for both Mac keyboard and corne to work:

for mac keyboard: (without corne) (and corne too) (all without karabiner)
- caps lock -> esc
- control -> caps lock
- options -> options

with the above setup, mac keyboard and coner in karabiner (all device):
- left_option -> left_control
- left_control -> left_option
